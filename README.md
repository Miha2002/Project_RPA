# Project_RPA

Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software.

This project was meant to simply showcase my knowledge of RPA and UiPath.

The RPA software robot is able to take the needed information from the credit card application google form, gather all the required documents from the individuals, make the necessary credit checks and decide whether or not an individual is eligible for a credit card based on the details that are provided in the previous steps.
If the person is eligible, they will receive an email informing them of their successfull credit card application.
